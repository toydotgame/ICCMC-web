			<h1>About ICCMC</h1>
			<p class="maintext">ICCMC was founded on the 15<sup>th</sup> of February, 2020, at 2:15:02 PM, with the seed <code>-5051958794457333090</code>. This is the same world we use today, and will be for as long as the server exists.</p><br>
			<p class="maintext">ICCMC started on a very bad server. Initially it had 3 GiB of RAM, a slow mobile Pentium CPU, was run on a slow and small external laptop HDD, had no backup system, and ran using the Mojang server software, which was <i>very</i> slow. And to make it worse, it wasn't a dedicated server PC – which meant that uptime was very low.<br>
			Eventually, the <strike>server</strike> laptop got some upgrades; it ran Spigot, it had 8 GiB of RAM, a reasonably fast (but not good) Core 2 Duo CPU, and it had multiple backup locations and it ran on an SSD. This was much better, but uptime was just as low because the server was <i>still</i> not seperate.<br>
			On the 26<sup>th</sup> of January, 2021, the server got moved to a ThinkCentre M58p (2008). It had half the RAM, a similar GPU, a slow old HDD, Ubuntu Server (instead of Windows 7) and a better backup system. Although the specs were far worse, the server' performance <i>improved</i>, due to the fact that the server was used for one purpose: Minecraft. Later on, the server got dedicated Ethernet, which helped uptime.<br>
			On the 26<sup>th</sup> of June, 2022, the server was upgraded to a new machine with a much higher RAM capacity, meaning that it could be upgraded to the latest version, 1.19.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Game Version</h2>
			<p class="maintext">Up until June 2022, ICCMC ran on Release 1.6.4. Past that point, it runs on a delayed-latest-version system, where the server is updated one month after a version is released, to compensate for development time for mods on the server- and client-side. The first version ICCMC ran after 1.6.4, under this new system, was Release 1.19.</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<p class="maintext">ICCMC has hosted a few major projects. Thank's to the server's long runtime goal, large-scale projects become much more feasible.</p>
			<h3>16-bit Partial ALU</h3>

			<br>
			<h2>ICCMC Test Server</h2>
			<p class="maintext">On the 12<sup>th</sup> of January, 2022, ICCMC started it's 1.18.2 test server. [As its name implied,] it was made to test the possibility and feasibility of maintaining a post-1.12 server (which is usually quite resource-intensive). The save wasn't guaranteed permanence; as <i>if</i> the server <i>did</i> upgrade, the initial (old) map would be used, instead of the test map.</p>
			<p class="maintext">On the 25-26<sup>th</sup> of June, 2022, ICCMC officially began work on a 1.19 upgrade. On the 26<sup>th</sup>, the 1.6.4 server that had been running since the server was created was shut down; in its place, a 1.19 Paper server was created with the same save (albeit with unexplored chunks deleted so that 1.19 terrain could more easily be accessed).</p>
