			<h1>About ICCMC</h1>
			<p>ICCMC was founded on the 15<sup>th</sup> of February, 2020, at 2:15:02 pm, with the seed <code>-5051958794457333090</code>. This is the same world in use today, and will be for as long as the server exists. ICCMC started out as a server with the gimmick being that it ran on Release 1.6.4 instead of the latest version.</p>
			<br>
			<p>ICCMC started on a laptop, rather than a dedicated server. Initially it had 3 GB of RAM, a Pentium T4400, and was run on a slow external HDD. It had no backup system and ran the Vanilla Minecraft server software. It was exceedingly slow, and had poor uptime as a result of not running on a dedicated computer.</p>
			<p>Eventually, the laptop was upgraded to 8 GB of RAM, a Core 2 Duo T9900, and (later) an SSD. It also got a backup system, albeit a manual one. Uptime didn't improve, however, as the device the server ran on hadn't changed. The server software was changed to Spigot in order to improve performance at the expense of Vanilla mechanics. On the 26<sup>th</sup> of January, 2021, the server was moved to a 2008 ThinkCentre M58p. Despite having half the RAM, and going back to running off a HDD, the server moved to Ubuntu Server instead of Windows as an OS, and now that it ran on a dedicated machine, uptime improved. Performance didn't take too much of a hit, either â€“ due to the computer doing nothing else other than Minecraft. Later, the server got ethernet to maintain a good uptime.</p>
			<p>On the 12<sup>th</sup> of January, 2022, ICCMC started its 1.18.2 test server. It was made to test the feasibility of running a post-1.6.4 release of the game on available server hardware. It ran on a temporary save for a few months with no guarantees of uptime.</p>
			<p>On June 26<sup>th</sup>, 2022, the server was moved to another machine with 16 GB of (admittedly slow) RAM, and a Core i3 CPU. ICCMC decided to move away from 1.6 in favour of a latest-release rolling model, and so it updated to a 1.19 (the latest at the time) version of Paper (dumping Spigot). Around August, the server software was switched to Fabric after the pleasant surprise of discovering base Fabric ran better than optimised Paper on the server's hardware. This meant that Vanilla mechanics had returned also. Nowadays, ICCMC runs roughly one month behind Mojang's release schedule, allowing for server and players' mods to update.</p>

			<h2>Projects</h2>
			<ul>
				<li><h3><a href="https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/redstone-discussion-and/redstone-creations/3099866-16-bit-partial-alu">16-bit Partial ALU</a></h3>
				<small>Built c. 2021 out of wool. Functions less as an ALU and more as a full adder with a Two's Complement toggle to allow for subtraction as well.</small></li>
				<li><h3>The ICCMC End Mining Project</h3>
				<small>toydotgame, with the help of thardwardy and Nebuloss117, mined over 1.2 million End Stone from the End dimension, completely removing the main End island and its Obsidian pillars.</small></li>
				<li><h3>Witch Hut Perimeter (WIP)</h3>
				<small>toydotgame and thardwardy are working on a basic 256x256 perimiter for a basic Witch Farm.</small></li>
