			<p class="maintxt">ICCMC is the ICC's longest-running Minecraft SMP server. It was founded on February 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020. ICCMC was officially recognised as the ICC's official SMP on September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020.</p>
			<p class="maintxt">ICCMC aims to create a good Vanilla Minecraft multiplayer experience via some of the following things:</p>
			<h3>No world resets!</h3><p class="maintxt">ICCMC will <b>never</b> reset its map for as long as it exists. It also aims to exist for as long as it can, on the same map; that means that you can rely on your work not going to waste after a world reset or the server shutting down permanently.</p>
			<h3>Pure Vanilla Minecraft experience</h3>
			<p class="maintxt">No gameplay-changing plugins or mods are used. It's just one Survival Mode world – a pure Vanilla Minecraft experience.</p>
			<h3>Properly hosted server</h3>
			<p class="maintxt">ICCMC is hosted on a dedicated Linux server with frequent automatic external backups, and has a text IP powered by self-updating dynamic DNS services. This means that you can join on the server's text IP and always be able to join, 24/7. Backups also ensure that the years of work done by many players is safe and secure.</p>
			<h2>Server Tour</h2>
			<p class="maintxt">This tour is somewhat out-of-date, but covers most of the Old Spawn area well.</p>
