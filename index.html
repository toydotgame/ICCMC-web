			<p>ICCMC is the ICC's longest-running Minecraft SMP server. It was founded on February 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020 and made official on September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020. ICCMC follows a casual Vanilla SMP style:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><h3>No world resets</h3>
				<small>ICCMC will <b>never</b> reset its map for as long as it exists. The server also aims to exist for as long as it can, with maximum possible uptime, on the same map â€“ which means you can rely on your hard work not going to waste after a world reset (nor do you have to fear the possibility of the server shutting down permanently unexpectedly).</small></li>
				<li><h3>Pure Vanilla Minecraft experience</h3>
				<small>There are no major gameplay-changing plugins, mods, or datapacks used. However, there are a few minor differences: Phantoms are disabled, minor crafting QoL tweaks, Endermen and Ghasts can't grief, multiplayer sleep, Vanilla Tweaks' <i>Silence Mobs</i> datapack, and Shulkers always drop 2 shells, and player-ridden Minecarts are faster. ICCMC has a single Survival-only world where everything is done legitimately.</small></li>
				<li><h3>Properly hosted server</h3>
				<small>ICCMC is hosted on a dedicated Linux server which backs up the world semiweekly, has a stable text IP, and maintains uptime by automatically recovering from power cuts regardless of if an admin is present to maintain the system. This means that you can rely on being able to connect to the IP 24/7, and your work will always be backed up and saved in multiple forms of media.</small></li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Server Tour</h2>
			<p>This tour is somewhat out-of-date, but covers the Old Spawn area alongside most players' bases well enough.</p>
